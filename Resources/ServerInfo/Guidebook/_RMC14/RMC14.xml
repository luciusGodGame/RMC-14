  #RMC-14 Guidebook

  Welcome to RMC-14.

  This is a MRP server inspired by CM13, in the new SS14 engine!

  The guidebook, roadmap and rules for the game can be found on the lobby screen, and at any point in the escape menu.

  Click any of the tabs on the left to learn about RMC14 and it's unique content.

  Be sure to read the rules if you haven't already.
  - [textlink="The rules" link="CMOverview"]

  New to RMC-14 or have no CM13 experience? Be careful! A lot of mechanics and values are not the same as SS14.
  (It's recomended to read the guidebook and learn basic controls from another server if this is your first time in SS14.)
