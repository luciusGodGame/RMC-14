  #Survivor Roleplay Standards
  - Survivors have more leeway than marines with mental stability due to trauma experienced during the xenonid attack. They may be suffering PTSD, paranoia or similar conditions for roleplaying purposes.
  - [bold]Survivors should not attack the hive before being rescued by the Marines.[/bold]
  - Standard survivors are not hostile to the Marines.
  - If there is an exception due to faction it will be clear.
  - Hostile Faction Survivors cannot attempt to harm other survivors.
  - [bold]Hunting or Securing Monkeys to deny Xenonid captures is considered Powergaming.[/bold]
