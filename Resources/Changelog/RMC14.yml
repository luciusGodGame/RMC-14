      close air support, orbital bombardment, second floor of the Almayer, the construction,
      medical or shotgun updates. No, instead we have this bug-fix because only one
      person had the dignity and self-respect to report it in an AHelp and one on

    type: Remove
  - message: Added the missing job slot scaling feature that will adjust how many
      of each marine role are available depending on how many marines are playing.
      The scaling depends on the specific role, with the heaviest adjustments happening
      to still unimplemented roles (mess technician and ordnance technician), but
      will for example allow up to 5 staff officers with 160 or more marines, with
      1 + 1 staff officer for each 40 marines, for a range of 2 to 5. The standard
      4 specs and sgs are available at 60 marines or above, with a minimum of 2 of
      each being available per round. This scaling won't affect research unlocking
      spec slots in the future once implemented.

  - message: Fixed HE mortar shell damage being lower than intended, not even breaking
      one regular wall. A single HE shell will now destroy a 3x3 of regular walls
      (3000 hp), but only deal 6000 damage to a reinforced wall (9000 hp). This doesn't
      change the damage it does to xenonids or marines, only structures.
    type: Fix
  - message: Fixed some Praetorian and Warden Praetorian abilities being usable while
      resting. Spit, spray acid, acid ball, retrieve and aid xenonid now are correctly
      no longer usable while the Praetorian is resting.

  - message: Fixed the popup for the Warden Praetorian's aid xenonid being incorrect
      for players other than the Praetorian and the target.
    type: Fix
  - message: Fixed the Warden Praetorian being able to gain internal hitpoints from
      spitting at a wall.
    type: Fix
  - message: Ported 13's 20-second cooldown for emote sounds. Anyone angered by this
      change should take it up with the hordes of people yawn and emote spamming during
      briefing in the middle of a Brigadier-General aboard the Almayer, or those spamming
      emotes in the dropship. Admins have better things to do than handle this dogshit
      rp every round. The scream hotbar action will always bypass this cooldown, also
      on a 20 second cooldown.

      of 3 living beings, with any more than that causing them to crash. Escape pods
      may also crash if launched early, except for the one in the Liaison's office.
